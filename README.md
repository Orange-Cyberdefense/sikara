# Sikara - Active Directory Hunting #


## Intro ##

Sikara has been developed in order to ease and assist the compromise of an Active Directory environment.

The idea behind the tool is to centralize and automate a certain number of tasks and checks in order to, in the best case, compromise a Domain Admin account.
Instead of starting from scratch and developing every request with the Python's lib Impacket, I chose to use basic tools that are available on every basic Kali distribution.
